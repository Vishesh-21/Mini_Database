Mini Database in Java

This project is a basic, file-based database built in Java, demonstrating core concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file handling. Designed for small-scale applications, this mini database allows data storage, retrieval, and management without the need for an external database system. It serves as an educational tool to understand fundamental database functionality and Java's file handling capabilities.

Features

Data Storage and Retrieval: Efficiently stores and retrieves data using files.
CRUD Operations: Implements basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
OOP Design: Structured around Java's OOP principles for a modular codebase.
File Handling: Leverages Javaâ€™s file handling capabilities to manage data without a relational database.

Technologies Used

Java: Core language for building the project.
File Handling (Java I/O): Manages data storage and persistence.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Provides structure and modularity to the code.
